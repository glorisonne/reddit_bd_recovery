im,6033,VBM,Z8mf/A3+ Z8mf/Z5,"I'm - noisy spelling/tokenisation error - assign as clear double membership to lexicon entry of I (Z8mf) and am (A3+ Z5)? In practice, only Z8mf will be assigned then, which is probably reasonable as I'm more likely to search for personal pronouns than for verbs in present tense? POS tag: VBM because specifically for ""am""? Or preprocess text and replace ""im"" with ""I am"" in all cases?"
